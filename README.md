# ADS-B Unique Aircraft Tracker

This Python script analyzes data from an ADS-B receiver tracking aircraft, specifically focusing on identifying unique aircraft within a specified time period. The script reads aircraft data from a JSON file, filters the data based on the 'seen' time, and then identifies unique aircraft based on their hexadecimal identifiers ('hex' codes).

## Features

- **Read and Parse JSON Data:** The script reads data from `aircraft.json`, which contains information about aircraft tracked by the ADS-B receiver.
- **Time Period Filtering:** Aircraft data is filtered to focus on a specific time period, such as the last 15 minutes.
- **Unique Aircraft Identification:** The script identifies unique aircraft based on their 'hex' codes within the specified time frame.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up the Data Source:**
   Ensure `aircraft.json` is available at `/run/readsb/aircraft.json` with current aircraft data from your ADS-B receiver.

2. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the script to analyze the data. By default, it processes data from the last 15 minutes. Modify the `minutes` parameter in `filter_data_by_time` function to change this duration.

3. **View Results:**
   The script outputs the number of unique aircraft detected in the specified time frame.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Access to `aircraft.json` generated by an ADS-B receiver.

## Example Output

```
Unique aircraft in the last 15 minutes: [Number]
```

## Customization

- **Time Frame Adjustment:** Change the `minutes` argument in the `filter_data_by_time` function to analyze a different time period.
- **File Path:** Update the `file_path` variable in the `main` function if your `aircraft.json` is located elsewhere.
